# Automation of the Meade Telescope at the Suhora Observatory

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a bachelor's thesis project implemented at the University of Zielona Gora. The goal of the project is to automate an auxiliary telescope ‚Äî Meade LX200 14‚Äù F/10 ACF ‚Äî and synchronize it with the main 600 mm Cassegrain telescope at the Suhora Astronomical Observatory. The project allows for fully automated, parallel astronomical observations using both instruments.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Project Overview

The system consists of three independent software modules, each running on a different machine. They communicate via a Redis server to exchange data in real time:

* **Main Telescope Monitoring Module**
  * Detects and processes new FITS files generated by the main telescope.
  * Extracts metadata (filter, exposure time, object type, etc.).
  * Sends structured observation data to the Redis server.

* **Meade Telescope Control Module**
  * Reads data from Redis and initiates an exposure using the CCD camera.
  * Controls ASCOM-compatible hardware: camera, filter wheel, and focuser.
  * Saves images as FITS (with complete header) and PNG preview.

* **Web Interface Module**
  * Displays current observation status and last-captured image.
  * Allows remote control of exposure time, filter position, and CCD temperature.
  * Writes user-defined settings back to Redis.
 
## üß† Technologies Used

* **Python 3.9+** ‚Äî primary programming language.
* **Redis** ‚Äî in-memory key-value database for data exchange.
* **ASCOM Platform** ‚Äî standardized control of astronomical devices.
* **Astropy** ‚Äî FITS file handling.
* **Dash (by Plotly)** ‚Äî web-based user interface.
* **WSL** ‚Äî Linux emulation for testing Redis and the monitor module.
* **ASCOM Simulators** ‚Äî for testing without physical hardware.
